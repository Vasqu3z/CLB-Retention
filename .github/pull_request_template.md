## Animation Checks
- [ ] Durations use shared motion tokens (≤280ms) and standard easing curves.
- [ ] Reduced-motion preference removes or shortens motion for fades, slides, tilts, and hovers.
- [ ] Shared variants (overlay, drawer, hover, page/section) are reused instead of custom transitions.
- [ ] Interactive states keep visible focus styles when animations are disabled.
